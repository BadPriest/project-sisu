Programming assignment: Frontend app
====================================

Dear Developer Candidate!

The assignment instructions: 
Write a modern client-side web application that fetches savings project data from https://sievo-react-assignment.azurewebsites.net/api/data
and displays that data on web page (grid).

We prefer to review React applications, however other modern JavaScript frameworks are accepted too.

The Requirements:
- Web page should look nice also with smaller resolutions (min width 650px)
If the value is too long to fit the cell, cut it instead of splitting to several rows
- User should be able to sort by start date.
- User should be able to search by description. E.g. if "Kryptonite" is written to search box, only rows
that contain text "Kryptonite" in descrption should be visible. Search text should be case insensitive.
- Display dates in format dd.mm.yyyy
- Null values (including the string "NULL") are displayed as empty cells
- Please use modern JavaScript. At least ES6.
- You can use any JavaScript library that you find suitable.

Please think about this assignment as a real project. Feel free to use any tools of
libraries you would on the job. The goal is to demonstrate, what kind of code you
write for a living and see that you share our enthusiasm for code quality.
We value maintainability, elegance and clarity over individual presentations excellence.

The end result of the assignment must contain source code for
the application and unit tests.

If you are unable to finish the whole assignment then write down the problems you
ran into so that we can discuss about them.

Deliver the source code as a link to a zip archive in some file-sharing service (e.g. Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud etc.)
Please don't use other compression formats than zip and don't encrypt the archive with a password.

Please do not post the code in a public repository on GitHub, GitLab or such.
